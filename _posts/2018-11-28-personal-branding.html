After reading Rachel Thomas's <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/">post</a> 
I decided that it was time for me as a new professional to begin my own blog as a way to help myself 
learn, share what projects I'm interested in, and to connect with new people.

My initial aversion to self-promotion stems from a distaste for shameless and constant self-promoters. 
The great thing and the worst thing about the internet is that it connects everyone to each other.
Thank you Instagram for letting everyone be their own PR agent (haha). But don't get me wrong. I love to 
hear about what cool things people are doing. Just as long as they remember to preserve the human element 
of our relationship and give back to the communities that they participate in as opposed to just taking.
<br><br>
Another issue I take with self-promotion (and networking as well) is the "icky" feeling. But I found what 
helps is to think of networking as simply making friends and building relationships. And to think of self-promotion as a way to give back to 
the community by sharing what I've learned, tutorials that I think will be of value, and insights that I've
found through my work.
<br><br>
I'll be keeping my head down mostly from here on out and working on my skills as a data scientist and
software engineer.
<br><br>
Here's to new beginnings.
