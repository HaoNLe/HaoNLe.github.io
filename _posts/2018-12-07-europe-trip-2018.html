In Spring 2018 I took a 2 month solo trip through Europe; I withdrew from school in December the year prior and booked a round trip flight from Oakland to London on a whim. I was experiencing feelings of discontent and anxiety about my future. Add on my spontaneous decision to buy tickets across the world and you could diagnose me with a mid-life crisis at quarter time.

I thought about what to pack for weeks and I even made a list. It was helpful for in the end I packed everything in a rush an hour before leaving for the airport. I hugged and kissed my mother goodbye as I entered the line to have myself scanned for weapons. I put my boots back on and stole one last glance at my mother.

The biggest challenge was the loneliness. At home I have the background hum of love and support from my family and friends but with that love and support came societal expectations. After spending a lifetime constantly reinforced by others to believe certain ideas about what made a successful life, I was more than willing to bare the isolation if I could have extended time just for myself. Of course, I still made many new friends along the way: I went clubbing in Barcelona with a troop of other travelers, grabbed ice cream and coffee in Hamburg with cool locals, and made a close friend in Krakow. However these friendships were ephemeral: you meet, hang out, and finally head your separate ways.

I met a man who redefined my definition of community. He managed an orphanage in Syria that had recently gotten bombed. Luckily the staff and children were evacuated in time. I met a woman in Krakow that helped redefine what I sought for in a relationship. Another fellow traveler taught me to approach life with vigor. Many others revealed my own life like a lens I didn't think to look through before.

McDonald's was an unexpected lifesaver. Their free wi-fi and public restrooms made life on the road easier. I was once dropped off about 15 miles south of Lyon, France. Out of data and disoriented, I sought refuge at a nearby McD's and was able to find the freeway to hitchhike my way into the city. Whenever I needed a break while exploring a city I could always get an ice cone break at a McDonald's.

As my return flight date approached I reflected. I didn't find a higher truth, a secret to life, or anything of the sort. As silly as I find it now, a part of me did want that: I thought perhaps a 2 month solo excursion away from everything I've ever known would stir in me some unrecognized passion that would carry me fearlessly through my young adult life. What I did find was an extra spring in my step, a greater penchant for saying yes, and that In-N-Out is the best after an 11 hour flight.
